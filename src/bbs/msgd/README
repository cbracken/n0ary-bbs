  The new code has been running now for a week or so without the
  mysterious dying problem. I am not sure why it all of a sudden started
  working. I did trace the cause to aging. When I disabled aging the 
  problem went away. When I turned it back on the problem returned.
  I then added a bunch of debugging code and the problem as again
  disappeared.

  I have noticed that when processes hang, such as a forward process,
  that msgd eats up a tremendous amount of memory storing the user
  update lists. Each user has a linked list of message pointers that
  have been altered since the last LIST command received from the
  active session.

  My plan is to give each user a date stamp when the last LIST was
  received. Each message entry will contain a similar stamp for the
  last time the message was modified. When a user requests a LIST
  the message database will be scanned for stamps more recent than
  the users date stamp.

  The only problem with this is messages that are purged. The user
  will not be notified of these. This shouldn't be a serious problem
  since KILLED messages are hidden from the users anyway. Also, the
  listing will straighten out as soon as the user disconnects.
