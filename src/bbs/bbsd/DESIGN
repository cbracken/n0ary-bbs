this daemon should be changed to support the following features/commands.

1. It should read a configuration file and supply configuration info
   on request from attached processes. The structure should be like this:

   The file, config.bbs, should be word string pairs:

   BBS_DIR	/bbs
   BBS_CALL	N0ARY
   BBS_PORT0 FALSE tTNC	TNC0	" 144.93 " TRUE  0
   BBS_PORT1 FALSE tTNC	TNC1	" 223.62 " TRUE  1
   BBS_PORT2 FALSE tTNC	TNC2 	" 433.37 " TRUE  2
   BBS_PORT3 TRUE  tPHONE	PHONE0	"749-1950" TRUE  0
   BBS_PORT4 TRUE  tPHONE	PHONE1	"749-0605" TRUE  1
   BBS_PORT5 TRUE  tCONSOLE	CONSOLE	"Console " TRUE  0
   BBS_PORT6 TRUE  FALSE	SERVER	" Server " FALSE 0
   BBS_PORT7 TRUE  FALSE	DAEMON	" Daemon " FALSE 0
   BBS_PORT8 TRUE  tSMTP	SMTP	"  SMTP  " TRUE  0
   BBS_PORT9 TRUE  FALSE	STATUS	" Status " FALSE 0
   BBS_PORT10 FALSE  tTNC	TNC3	" 441.50 " TRUE	 3
   etc.

   bbsd should be provided with this file as a command line parameter.
   It will parse the file and save the contents in a linked list.

   Some of the fields will be used by bbsd but most will just be held
   and distributed as requests are made. This allows configuration
   fields to be added to the file without having to teach bbsd to
   understand them.

   bbsd will also allow all fields to be overridden during runtime but
   continue to save the original value for comparison purposes.

2. It should be changed to take the standard communications model
   as the other daemons.

3. bbsd should be responsible for starting and maintaining all the
   daemons. Daemons should be changed to connect to bbsd before
   initialization of databases. This will allow bbsd to know a 
   restart has been successful.

	DAEMON MSGD /bbs/bin/msgd
	DAEMON USERD /bbs/bin/userd
	DAEMON GATED /bbs/bin/gated
	DAEMON TNC0 /bbs/bin/tncd TNC0
	DAEMON TNC1 /bbs/bin/tncd TNC1
	etc.

   It will check for connections to each of these on a regular basis
   and restart when absent.

   All dameons daemons should be changed to expect a -hHOST and -pNUMBER
   options to indicate where to find the bbsd socket.
