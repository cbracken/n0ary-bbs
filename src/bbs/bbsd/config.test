##  BBS Configuration Rules
####
#
# Entries in this file are keyword value pairs. The keyword is
# a string that starts in column 1 and begins with a letter.
# The value field is separted from the keyword by white space.
#
# Values have an associated type. The posible types are:
#   STRING, NUMBER, DIRECTORY, FILE and TIME
#
# When specifying a DIRECTORY or FILE if the first character
# is a slash '/' then the path is considered to be absolute.
# If it begins with a character other than a slash the field
# represented by BBS_DIR is prepended. DIRECTORY values should
# not end with a slash.
#
# The TIME values are a number followed by the quantity
# definition, ie. SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS, WEEKS,
# MONTHS or YEARS.
#
# Comments are lines that begin with a '#'. Comments cannot
# be appended to the end of KEYWORD/VALUE pairs.
