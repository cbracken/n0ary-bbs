  Altered msgd to not handle changed messages in the same fashion.
  The result is that we will no longer be getting the +-* keys to
  tell what happened to a message. We will simply get the message
  entry again. We will therefore have to scan the message list to
  see if it is a new message or a change to an existing one.
