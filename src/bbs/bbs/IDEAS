* fix wp search command

* allow multiple WHEN statements for a BBS.

* setting email forwarding on alternate user doesn't reflect alternet user
setting, shows your own. you also don't seem to be about to turn on an
alternate user.

* return undelivered mail

* wp with no argument should give stats and altered

* command to tell tnc driver to flush outgoing packets. This would
  make it possible to interrupt long printouts.

* "Your LIST request has resulted in xxx matches (Q/Page/Dump)"

* ignore CR's at the main menu level?

* The informing the user of bad distribution issue

* run translation twice, first time to isolate ALLUS type stuff, no
  real command execution.

=====================
SP N0ZZZ

	see if user is in wp, if so address

The bbs doesn't know which bbs this user uses
Please supply homebbs: N0XXX

	see if bbs is in wp, if so address

This bbs doesn't know where the bbs N0XXX is located. You will have
to supply a hiearchical address, CA.USA.NA is an example.
Please supply hloc for N0XXX: MO.USA.NA

============
How about implementing the unix "talk" command on the bbs?  Here's
a scenario:

I'm logged in via. land-line or 440 and someone I know is logged in
via. 144.  I want to chat with them in real-time.  It would be nice
to be able to go into cross-band digipeat mode.

Anyway, it's just a though.
oops, thought.  (I gotta start editing my messages off-line...)

===========
tickler, WD6CMU, when a message gets so old, inform the sysop if
the user doesn't use the bbs as home normally.

* sender of a HELD message should be able to kill it.

* change ECHO to DUPLEX [FULL|HALF]

* make ECHO just that, ECHO WHAT FOLLOWS. We can use that to check
  the new pipe function.

* do we have a problem with multiple connects from same user?

======================

QMY:
chat script for forwarding should contain conditional branches, timeouts.

if forwarding to a bbs fails x number of times route traffic automatically.


 ==========

use servers for wp.
