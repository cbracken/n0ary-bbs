; This file defines all the bbss we can talk to. If there is a route
; present in the Route file it has to be resolved here.
; 
; A bbs entry begins by putting the bbs call in column 1. All of the
; subsequent lines, upto the next line that begins in column 1, define
; options for that bbs.
;
; BBSCALL alias_list

;   PORT string
;   CONNECT string
;   AX25 parameters

;   SEND string
;
;
; Let's look at these individually. The BBS and alias list would look like
; this:
;
; N6QMY GATEWAY NTSBBS
;   PORT SMTP
;   .....
;
; AA4RE GATEWAY
;   PORT TNC1
;   .....
;
;
; In the above example both bbss have the alias of GATEWAY. This allows
; either one of these to pick up the messages being forwarded to GATEWAY.
; 
; If N6QMY went off line unexpectedly then AA4RE will automatically
; get all the GATEWAY stuff. We could also add the alias NTSBBS to another
; bbs entry and it would be redirected.

; WHEN defines when we are allowed to initiate a connection to a remote
; bbs. It can take on any of the following forms:
;
;   WHEN NEVER			never connect, but we can be polled
;   WHEN 0100 0600 		any day between 1am and 6am
;   WHEN 0100 0600 135		between 1 and 6am on Mon, Wed, Fri
;   WHEN * 12345		anytime on weekdays
;   WHEN * *                    anytime, anyday (same as not having a WHEN)
;
; The TIMES field can be replaced by an '*' to mean anytime. The same
; applies to the DOW (DayOfWeek) field. The DOW field is the day number
; with Sunday being 0, Monday being 1, etc.
;
; OPTS is where we add configuration information to the bbs entry.
;
;   OPTS DUMBTNC		No SID or OK/NO responses expected
;   OPTS POLL			Connect even if we have no mail for him
;   OPTS NOREVFWD		Don't allow reverse forwarding
;   OPTS MULTIPLE		On SMTP forward you can batch up messages
;   OPTS AGE 4 DAYS		Forward if messages are over 4 days old
;
; Only the first letter of the options is important and multiple options
; can be concatenated.
;
;   OPTS DUMBTNC NOREVFWD
;   OPTS D N
;
; ORDER indicates in which order messages are to be forwarded. If the
; field is missing messages will forward in chronological order, oldest
; first. Otherwise you supply a string including the characters P, B and
; T to show the order.
;
;   ORDER PTB			forward Personal then nTs then Bulletins
;   ORDER PT			forward Personal then nTs, skip Bulletins
;
; PORT defines the method to be used to connect to the remote bbs. The
; token must match one of those defined in the PORT entries in the 
; Config file.
;
; CONNECT is used in conjunction with the PORT field. It takes on 
; different meanings depending on PORT. Some examples will help.
;
;   N6LDL			Connect to N6LDL on TNC 1 as N6LDL-1
;     PORT TNC1
;     CONNECT N6LDL-1
;
;   N6QMY GATEWAY		Forward to N6QMY via email
;     PORT SMTP
;     CONNECT import@bbs.lbc.com
;
;   WB0TAX			Open a socket to machine wb0tax on port 54
;     PORT TCP
;     CONNECT wbotax.arasmith.com 54
;
; In the last example, the hostname must be in your hosts file and if a 
; port number is not supplied 23 is the default, the telnet port. A
; future enhancement will allow IP address to be used instead of
; machine name.
; 
; AX25 is used to define tnc parameters on a per station basis.
;
;   AX25 T1 seconds
;   AX25 T2 seconds
;   AX25 T3 seconds
;   AX25 MAXFRAME num
;   AX25 PACLEN num
;   AX25 N2 num
;
; Refer to the TNC definition portion of the Config file or your tnc
; manual for explanation of these variables.
;   
; RECV and SEND define a chat script that is needed to login to the
; remote machine/bbs.
;
;   WB0TAX
;     OPTS POLL
;     PORT TCP
;     CONNECT wb0tax 23
;     RECV ogin:
;     SEND n0ary
;     RECV assword:
;     SEND letmein
;     RECV >
;     SEND C tna wb0tax
;
; Following the last RECV/SEND line in the script the input stream is
; monitored looking for a SID string or the bbs prompt '>'. At that time
; control is given to the bbs.
;
; There are some caveats with this scripting that I am still working
; on. If you need to do this now please contact me.

; Here are some examples of games that can be played.
;
;   N6QMY GATEWAY
;     PORT TNC1
;     CONNECT N6QMY-1
;
;   AA4RE GATEWAY
;     ORDER B
;     AGE 2 DAYS
;     PORT TNC0
;     CONNECT AA4RE
;
;   AA4RE
;     PORT TNC0
;     CONNECT AA4RE
;
; This will forward GATEWAY stuff to N6QMY until he is gone for more
; than 2 days. At which time AA4RE will begin getting just the bulletins.
; Messages destined for just AA4RE would be delayed 2 days if only the
; first entry where present. The second entry for AA4RE will pass these
; immediately.

;   N6QMY GATEWAY
;     PORT TCP
;     CONNECT lbc.com
;
;   N6QMY GATEWAY
;     AGE 8 HOURS
;     PORT TNC1
;     CONNECT N6QMY-1
;
; If we loose our IP link to lbc.com for 8 hours begin forwarding the
; messages via TNC 1.
