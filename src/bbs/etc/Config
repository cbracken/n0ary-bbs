;#  BBS Configuration Rules
;###
;
; This file is read by bbsd to do runtime configuration of the
; bbs. All values in this file can be changed dynamically by
; connecting to bbsd.
;
; Entries in this file are keyword value pairs. The keyword is
; a string that starts in column 1 and begins with a letter.
; The value field is separted from the keyword by white space.
;
; Values have an associated type. The posible types are:
;   STRING, NUMBER, DIRECTORY, FILE and TIME
;
; -----TOTALLY INACCURATE!!!!!!
; When specifying a DIRECTORY or FILE if the first character
; is a slash '/' then the path is considered to be absolute.
; If it begins with a character other than a slash the field
; represented by BBS_DIR is prepended. DIRECTORY values should
; not end with a slash.
; -----TOTALLY INACCURATE!!!!!!
;
; The TIME values are a number followed by the quantity
; definition, ie. SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS, WEEKS,
; MONTHS or YEARS.
;
; Comments are lines that begin with a ';'. Comments cannot
; be appended to the end of KEYWORD/VALUE pairs.
;
;

;===============================================================
; We will begin with the variables that are often unique to a
; bbs installation.
;===============================================================

; This is the list of daemons that bbsd will spawn and maintain. It
; can also be used to start other programs as well. If the second
; field is "IGNORE" then bbsd will simply exec the program and 
; ignore it. Otherwise the program is exec'd and bbsd watches to
; make sure it establishes a connection and continues to run. If
; one of these programs dies bbsd will start another copy.
; 

;DAEMON IGNORE	/bbs/bin/your.program.here

; These daemons have to be started

DAEMON MSGD	/bbs/bin/b_msgd
DAEMON LOGD	/bbs/bin/b_logd
DAEMON WPD	/bbs/bin/b_wpd
DAEMON BIDD	/bbs/bin/b_bidd
DAEMON GATED	/bbs/bin/b_gated
DAEMON USERD	/bbs/bin/b_userd

; Just enable these for the RF links you have

DAEMON TNC0	/bbs/bin/b_tncd TNC0
DAEMON TNC1	/bbs/bin/b_tncd TNC1
DAEMON TNC2	/bbs/bin/b_tncd TNC2

; This variable defines the root location for all FILE variables. It
; will automatically be prepended to all requests for FILE type vars.

BBS_DIR         /bbs

; Who and where are we? Change this to your call (without the -X) and
; your hloc. For those of you that have to deal with a second hloc
; add it as BBS_HLOC_COMP.

BBS_CALL		N0ARY
BBS_HLOC		#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA
BBS_HLOC_COMP		#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA.NOAM
BBS_DOMAIN		bbs.arasmith.com

; These are for the tnc drivers. The MYCALL entry is the call
; others will connect to. The FWDCALL is what your outgoing
; connections will go as. They can be different calls if you
; wish. At the minimum they should be different SSIDs.

BBS_MYCALL		N0ARY-1
BBS_FWDCALL		N0ARY-2

; Call sign of the primary sysop and the sysop password

BBS_SYSOP		N0AAA
BBS_SYSOP_PASSWD	letmein

; This is the stuff that is added to the end of your R: line.

BBS_HEADER_COMMENT	Sunnyvale, CA

; This is the internet address where people should send requests
; for info on registering with your gateway. If you would like
; just leave this the same and I will distribute the info. If you
; choose to do this send me your address particulars, domain, etc.
; I will modify my info file to show all of the gateways using
; this code.

GATE_INFO_ADDRESS	gateway_info@arasmith.com

; The following are new user defaults. When a person first connects
; you will setup his account as shown.

USERD_DEF_MACRO0	list mine; list unread club
USERD_DEF_MACRO1	read mine; kill mine
USERD_DEF_MACRO2	list unread clubs
USERD_DEF_MACRO3	list unread from N6ZFJ to USERS
USERD_DEF_MACRO4
USERD_DEF_MACRO5
USERD_DEF_MACRO6
USERD_DEF_MACRO7
USERD_DEF_MACRO8
USERD_DEF_MACRO9	help all

; Although all the user fields are not shown here you can define
; a default for any of the user account variables. You simply
; prepend USER_DEF_ to the front of the userd variable name.
; If a default is not present here it is just set to FALSE or NULL
; in the new users account.

; All users should be allowed on CONSOLE and SMTP. The others are
; optional. In my case I don't allow users to connect on my 220
; port that is used for forwarding, thus TNC1 is not in this list.

USERD_DEF_ALLOWED	TNC0 TNC2 TNC3 PHONE0 CONSOLE SMTP
USERD_DEF_LINES		20
USERD_DEF_HELP		3
USERD_DEF_LOGGING	TRUE
USERD_DEF_APPROVED	TRUE

; Now here we get a little muddy. This is where you define what
; ports you have on your system. You can change these anyway you
; like and in any order but make sure you have CONSOLE, SERVER,
; DAEMON, SMTP and STATUS in the list. These are special ports
; used by the bbs and daemons.

;###
;#	PORT DEFINITIONS
;###
;
; Name:	The handle by which you refer to this port. This is used
;	all over the bbs. For instance the starting of the tnc
;	daemons above, the USERD_DEF_ALLOWED variable, etc.
;
; Type:	This just defines the kind of port. If it is TNC then the
;	bbs knows it has to call the tnc daemon to make a connection,
;	and so on.
;
;	  TNC		connects to tncd process
;	  PHONE		opens a device
;	  TCP		connects to a host/port
;	  CONSOLE
;	  SYSTEM
;
; Secure: This field specifies whether a user is allowed to become
;	sysop while connect via this port. Since passwords would be
;	passed as clear text over packet TNC ports should never be
;	set as secure.
;
; Show: The user can display a list of ports from inside the bbs. 
;	Rather than have to keep explaining to users what port
;	TCP is and why they can't use it you simply set the SHOW
;	field to FALSE. It will hide it's existance from the user.
;
; Alias: This is the name for this port in verbose text. When a user
;	asks to see the ports TNC0 will probably not mean much to 
;	him, but the ports frequency may. This field should be
;	limited to 8 characters max.

;	Name	Type	Secure	Show	Alias
PORT	TNC0	TNC	FALSE	TRUE	144.93
PORT	TNC1	TNC	FALSE	TRUE	223.62
PORT	TNC2	TNC	FALSE	TRUE	433.37
PORT	TNC3	TNC	FALSE	TRUE	441.50
PORT	PHONE0	PHONE	TRUE	TRUE	749-1950
PORT	PHONE1	PHONE	TRUE	TRUE	749-0605
PORT	PHONE2	PHONE	TRUE	TRUE	749-9788
PORT	CONSOLE	CONSOLE	TRUE	TRUE	Console
PORT	SERVER	SYSTEM	FALSE	FALSE	Server
PORT	DAEMON	SYSTEM	FALSE	FALSE	Daemon
PORT	SMTP	SMTP	FALSE	TRUE	SMTP
PORT	TCP	TCP	FALSE	TRUE	TCP
PORT	STATUS	SYSTEM	FALSE	FALSE	Status

; The table above defined the ports. But in some cases we will need
; far more information to actually use them. For instance the tncs.

;###
;#	TNC DEFINITIONS
;###
;
; Name: Must match "name" variable in PORT definitions above.
;
; dPort: This is the data port for the tnc daemon.
; cPort: This is the control port for the tnc daemon.
;	Refer to the manual on tncd for further explanation of what
;	these are used for.
;
; Device: UNIX path for the device OR
;         hostname:port for TCP connection to a terminal server.
;
; Host: Where is the physical hardware located?
;
; The rest are AX25 definitions
; T1: The number of seconds to wait for a response from the remote
;	tnc confirming frame reception. Make this loose. Remember that
;	tncd only knows when the frame was sent to the tnc, not when it
;	was actually transmitted.
;
; T2: How long to wait after receiving a packet before you confirm.
;
; T3: How often to ping the remote station to see if it is still there
;	when idle.
;
; MaxFrame: The maximum number of frames that will be sent without
;	waiting for an acknoledgement. The maximum is 7, poor links
;	should be lower.
;
; Paclen: The maximum size packet that can be sent. I believe the maximum
;	is 256 but you have some overhead that AX25 adds. 220 is a good
;	max value for me. Bad links should lower this, possibly as low
;	as 64.
;
; N2: Retry count. If you issue something this many times and don't get
;	thru, dump the connection.
;
; My strategy on the user ports is to dump as big of frames and as many
; as possible. I figure the user must be hearing me pretty well, don't
; waste a bunch of time with acknoledgments.

;#	PHONE DEFINITIONS
;###
;
; This defines where a modem is located and how to establish a connection
; to it. As well as an initialization chat script. Since outgoing phone
; connections are not supported at this time this is just preparation for
; things to come.

;	Name	Device		Host	Chat Script

; This is the WP stuff. Where do you want your updates sent

WPD_GLOBAL_SERVER	WP@N6IYA.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA

; This is for something we use in northern CA. You have probably
; noticed that WP is a write only database, you send updates in
; but never get anything back. Well this bbs supports downstream
; updating. It will generate an update of just USER supplied
; data and send to this address. It doesn't distribute all the
; guesses and assumptions that show up in the normal updates.
; Comment this line out if you don't want to support this 
; feature.

WPD_LOCAL_DISTRIB	WP@NCWP

;===============================================================
; That should do it. If you don't change anything else in this
; file you should still come up and run. Just review the rest of
; the variables and alter to fit your individual tastes.
;===============================================================

; On the hosts you can use a host name rather than the aliases shown
; here.

BBS_HOST	bbshost
MAIL_HOST	mailhost
SMTP_PORT	25

BIN_DIR			bin
BBS_SID			[ARY-4.0-H$]

; This is the port number that bbsd listens on. You are free to change
; all the port numbers but it would be nice if we all used the same
; ports. It would allow us to maintain each others code easier when
; someone goes on vacation.

;#  BIDD - Bid Daemon

BIDD_AGE	3 months

;###
;#  GATED - Gateway Daemon
;###

; Internet users can have multiple addresses mapped into their call
; for incoming messages. Of course they will never tell you when they
; are not needed. A mail message is sent to a user at an address as
; soon as that address hasn't been used for GATED_AGE_WARN time. If
; the user doesn't use that address before GATED_AGE_KILL time the
; entry will be deleted. If all users addresses are killed then when
; userd runs it's aging the user will be purged.

; too often or the daemon will always be busy. Users are locked out while
; aging is being done. Of course if you don't age often enough then it
; takes longer to do and the users are locked out for longer periods of
; time.

MSGD_AGE_INTERVAL	1 hour

; The bbs displays a message as old when it is MSGD_AGE_OLD from being
; killed. Just a little warning that it's hours are limited.

MSGD_AGE_OLD		2 days

; MSGD_AGE_?_ACTIVE defines the default time that a message of this type
; will stay on the bbs. Even after a message has been killed it isn't
; purged from the system. We keep it around for MSGD_AGE_?_KILLED to allow
; the user to beg us to correct his mistake. Going rate $5 :)
;
; The ACTIVE setting can be overridden from the Translate file on a per
; message basis. Such as SALE@ALLUS messages can be aged at 1 day while

;#  USERD - User Daemon
;###
; 
USERD_ACC_PATH		user

; USERD_AGE_INTERVAL is how often the user database is aged. To often
; will cause users to be locked out often. Not often enough an it will
; take longer to run. This may not make any difference to the average
; bbs. If you only have 100 users you can just do this once a day, or
; once a week. I have over 1300 users and it takes a long time to run
; so I run it hourly.

USERD_AGE_INTERVAL	1 hour

; Users are killed after certain periods of inactivity. I age different
; classes of users at different timeframes. Those using the bbs as HOME
; are given more time, suspect calls are aged quick.
;
; Users can be made immune to aging as well as put themselves into a 
; vacation mode that will protect them from aging.

USERD_AGE_HOME		4 months
USERD_AGE_NOTHOME	3 months
USERD_AGE_NONHAM	1 month
USERD_AGE_SUSPECT	1 week

; 

; I think W0RLI requires this exact subject line on WP updates. Also
; how often and how big the updates can be. Update larger than 
; WPD_UPDATE_SIZE will be broken into smaller pieces. The WPD_HOUR

; WP entries are aged out of the database after WPD_AGE inactivity.
; WPD_REFRESH is how often we will refresh an active user, add him
; to the updates. A change in a user will force an update for the
; next cycle automatically.

WPD_AGE			6 months
WPD_REFRESH		14 days

; This is how often to write a changed memory image to disk.
