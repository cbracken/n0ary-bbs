; when a message is received on the system it is checked against this

; The replacement strings can be constants or other parts of the message
; definition. For example you may recieve a message that you wish to
; write into the filesystem. As the title you may want to use the TO
; field. You specify the field you want to use as [field]. Possible 
; fields are:
;
;  [TO] [AT] [FROM] [BID] [SUBJECT]
;
; The commands will need additional explanation. We will discuss them
; one at a time. Look through my examples in the main body of this
; file for clarification.
;
; !PRINT string
;	The bbs will display this string to the user. Use it to tell
;	him why you are doing something to his message. 
;
; !HOLD string
;	Message is placed on hold. It remains in the listing but will
;	not be forwarded nor will the average user be able to read it.
;	The command READ WHY will tell the user why a message was
;	placed on hold. When a message is held via the Translate file
;	the text following the HOLD command becomes the reason.
;
; !DONE
;	The file is traversed top to bottom. And a message can match
;	multiple rules. This command will stop terminate the translate
;	function, not check the rest of the file.
;
; !NOFWD
;	Message will not be forwarded.
;
; !IMMUNE
;	Message will be immune from aging.
;
; !KILL
;	Message will be killed
;
; !INIT server
;	Start a server, callbk, wp, etc. and feed this message to it.
;
; !COPY address
;	Create a copy of the message and mail it to "address".
;
; !MAIL address
;	Similar to COPY but sends the message via email. If no address
;	is supplied the message body is checked for a valid To: line on
;	the first line of the body.
;
; !WRITE filename
;	Write a message to the filesystem area.
;

; Now for some examples. Let's start off with a complex one.

; First we try to translate all the possible incarnations of FORSALE
; into SALE. This simplifies pattern matching on later rules.

>SELL:		>SALE
>4SALE:		>SALE
>FORSAL:	>SALE

@ALLUSA:	@ALLUS
@ALLBBS:	@ALLUS

; This example take a message addressed to SALE@ALLUS and informs the
; user that these are no longer accepted at this bbs. It then changes
; the bulletin to a personal message, returns it to the sender with
; BBS as the new originator and kills the original bulletin.

>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT Messages to SALE@ALLUS are no longer supported
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT by the northern Ca BBSs. Please consider sending
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT your message again to a smaller distribution
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT such as ALLSCV (Santa Clara Valley) or
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT ALLCAN (California North).
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT Your message is being returned to you.
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	!PRINT Please type INFO SALE for more info.
>SALE @ALLUS$ |H:	|P >[FROM] <BBS @N0ARY !KILL !DONE

@ALLUS &SALE |H:	!HOLD !DONE ; Possible SALE message to @ALLUS

; That last one tries to catch SALE messages of the form ??@ALLUS with the
; word SALE in the subject somewhere.

; The !DONE keeps us from scanning down through the rest of the Translate
; file and hitting other rules that may relate to @ALLUS messages in
; general.

@NOCAL:		@ALLCAN
@NCAL:		@ALLCAN
@ALLNCA:	@ALLCAN
@SOCAL:		@ALLCAS

; @ALLUS bulletins more than 5 days old should not be forwarded. Same with
; @WW.

@ALLUS |B +5:	!NOFWD 
@WW |B +5:	!NOFWD 

; Kill messages that should not have entered our area.

@COCO:		!KILL !DONE

; All messages to SYSOP will be mailed to my unix account and time-to-live
; will be set to 2 days rather than the default of 5 days.

>SYSOP:		+2 !MAIL bob@arasmith.com

; BBS's and people that have changed calls

>KC6SON:	>AB6OZ		; 10/1/92
>KD6DIH:	>KM6RI		; 2/20/93
>KA6BII:	>AB6QZ		; 3/1/93
>N6ZPN:		>KN6NR		; 6/27/93

; Hold all mail originated from certain users.

<N6UUM:		!HOLD	; History of commercial traffic
<KK6AN:		!HOLD	; Check content before releasing

; Here is a guy that is using two bbss as his home. To make this work
; he uses his wife's call at the other bbs. So we send duplicates of
; each message to the other bbs.

>N6FW:		!COPY KC6DLE@N6IYA

; This fellow moved. This rule will cause all of his mail to be
; readdressed to his new bbs. 

>N2MZN:		@WB2ARS			; 12/4/93

; Email certain bulletins to interested parties

@NCPA:		!MAIL steveh@grafex.Cupertino.CA.US

; Forward bbs status messages to special account where they will be
; forwarded to my unix mailbox and deleted.
>IPGATE @N0ARY:		!MAIL !KILL !DONE
>IPGATE |H:		!MAIL !KILL !DONE
>AUTHOR @N0ARY:		!MAIL bbs_authors@arasmith.com !KILL
>CSBBS @N0ARY:		!MAIL csbbs@arasmith.com !KILL
>HAMSRV @N0ARY:		!MAIL HAMSRV@grafex.Cupertino.CA.US !KILL
>K3MC:			!MAIL cwi@netcom.com

; Personal mailbox forwarding.

>N6ZFJ:		@N6ZFJ
>N6MWC:		@N6MWC
>N6FZY:		@N6FZY
>K6SDE:		@K6SDE

; Make the following messages immune from automatic aging.
>USERS <N0ARY:		!IMMUNE		; My to user messages
>USERS <N0ARY:		!MAIL rwp@hprwp.fc.hp.com
>EXAMS:		!IMMUNE		; Messages about local exams
>FAQ:		!IMMUNE
>WN1Z:		!IMMUNE		; Only checks in every few weeks, Big Sur area

; Check for server operations

>CALLBK:	!INIT CALLBK
>WP:		!INIT WP

; This is only marginally successful, the bid is used to try to
; isolate just the mods server.
