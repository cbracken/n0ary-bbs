# This file is the script to lead a user through the addressing of a
# message that isn't in our White Pages and doesn't have a hloc supplied
# by the user.
#
# Since this info is very particular to the area you are in it is simpler
# to handle it here in a separate file rather than muddy up the help system.
#
# Lines that begin with a question mark will be asked of the user. If an
# affirmative answer is received than the following lines up to the next
# question line are displayed. If the answer is negative then the bbs will
# scan forward to the next question.
#
# Since this is an if-else type of thing when you have asked the last
# question you will probably want to display a canned response to a 
# negative answer as well. This is identified by a line beginning with
# a '!'. The rest of the file will be displayed for the user.
#
# Here is an example of what the user might see:
#
#   SEND N4ZZZ@W4AAA
#	The HOMEBBS that has been specified is unknown to this bbs. I will
#   need a additional information to figure out where to route the message.
#	Is the BBS in California (Y/n/q)? N
#   Is the BBS in the United States (Y/n/q)? Y
#   Please supply the two letter state abbreviation.         
#	CO
#

?Is the BBS in California?
These are the regions within California

   #NOCAL.CA.USA.NOAM  -- Northern California
   #CENCA.CA.USA.NOAM  -- Central California
   #SOCAL.CA.USA.NOAM  -- Southern California

Please enter the correct HLOC for the target region: 
#
?Is the BBS in the United States?
Routing to the state may be sufficient. With luck once in the state a
bbs there will be able to complete the addressing. The HLOC will be
the two letter state abbreviation with .USA.NOAM appended.

?Is the BBS in North America?
This is getting pretty coarse. Supplying just the country and continent
is probably not enough but you could give it a try.

	CAN.NOAM -- Canada           CYM.NOAM -- Cayman Is.
	CRI.NOAM -- Costa Rica       CUB.NOAM -- Cuba
	GRL.NOAM -- Greenland        GTM.NOAM -- Guatemala
	MEX.NOAM -- Mexico           PAN.NOAM -- Panama
	PRI.NOAM -- Puerto Rico      VIR.NOAM -- US Virgin Is.

Please enter HLOC of country: 
!
To send messages to other continents requires at least the country code
and the continent code to stand a chance of making it. Depending on the
area further info may be necessary. For instance if the bbs is in France
you need at least FRA.EURO. The posible continent codes are:

	NOAM -- North America          AUNZ -- Australia/New Zealand
	CEAM -- Central America        NPAC -- Northern Pacific
	CARB -- Caribbean              SPAC -- Southern Pacific
	SOAM -- South America          WPAC -- Western Pacific

	EURO -- Europe                 NAFR -- Northern Africa
	INDI -- Indian Ocean           SAFR -- Southern Africa
	MDLE -- Middle East
	MEDR -- Mediterranean          ANTR -- Antarctica
	ASIA -- The Orient
