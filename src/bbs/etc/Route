; The Route file is used to define where a message is to be
; forwarded. There are two parts to the file, group definitions
; and the routes themselves.
;
; Please be familiar with the Systems file prior to studying this
; file. All the destinations found in this file must be defined
; in the Systems file.

; The group definitions are just short cuts to keep your typing
; to a minimum. The groups are identified by the leading underscore.

; The routes portion of the file is scanned from top to bottom looking
; for a match to a message criteria, just like the Translate file.
; If a match is found the scan is complete and the message is forwarded
; to the list of aliases/calls/groups present on that line.
;
; Match criteria is the same as in the Translate file although many
; of the available fields will go unused. I cannot imagine a reason
; why you would want to route on a message subject but it is possible.
; There maybe some value to routing on message age or message type.

; First you have to handle your own bbs. I know I could have coded this
; in but special casing the routine seemed wrong.

; Next lets address HLOCs. An HLOC should be parsed from right to
; left ignoring any domain that you are a member of. Your HLOCs
; where defined in the Config file as BBS_HLOC and BBS_HLOC_COMP.
; Given @W2XO.#EPA.PA.USA.NOAM and I am @N0ARY.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA the
; process would first look at the right most element, N0AM. Since
; I am also in NOAM it is ignored. The next component is USA. Again
; I am in USA so ignore it. Now we reach PA, I'm not in PA so it is
; a valid component to compare.

; So begin by defining the right most tokens, the continents.
; The two leter versions, notice NOAM and NA are not present.

; Now we address sections within CA. Luckily there are very few.
; Again ignore #NOCAL, that's us.

.#CENCA:	KM6PX
.#SOCA.*:	AA4RE		; matches #SOCA and #SOCAL

; Notice the use of ".*" to match any character any number of times.
; Normally kind of dangerous. It would have also matched #SOCANADA
; if that existed. But that would have been routed by the .CAN in
; the country section.

; Next we have to address each of the bbss that reside inside #NOCAL.
; I won't put them all here, too many. They can be coded as either 
; HLOC or AT. Either will work.

; and so on, there are about 50 of these now.

; Now here is an interesting problem. If you are given a address
;   @N6QMY.#EPA.PA.USA.NOAM
; but you think this bbs is actually
;   @N6QMY.#NOCAL.CA.USA.NA
; where do you send it. Do you trust the user or override with your
; data? If you know you know where the bbs is just put the bbs entries
; above the HLOC checks. If you leave them down here the message would
; go to PA. Of course if the bbs moves you may be moving the message
; in the wrong direction.


; Now let's cover NTS, qualify the message as NTS these routes are
; only valid if the user sent them as NTS.
