Extending the BBS with "doors".

In the spirit of classical bulletin board systems of old, N0ARY supports
extending the BBS experience with external programs called "doors". A door
is a program, separate from the BBS, which can be spawned and which will take
over interaction with the user until he or she is finished with the program.

The BBS conveys information to the door through environment variables. The
following are passed:

  BBS_DIR=<BBS_DIR>
  BBS_USER=<USERCALL>
  BBS_USER_LINES=<LINES>
