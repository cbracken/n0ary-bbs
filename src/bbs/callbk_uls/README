The age of HAM callbooks on CD-ROM has long passed (as of 2017) so the
usefulness of the callbook import utility (make_cb) provided with the
N0ARY 4.1.1 source code is low. Yet the FCC now freely gives away the entire
amateur radio database on-line, which makes it cheap and fast to obtain. This
utility parses the FCC ULS data and replace the make_cb utility.
