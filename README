Pat,

Begin by building the bbs. From this directory:

uncompress SRC
tar xf SRC
rm SRC
make link

Then if you are using a compiler other than gcc you will have to
edit the file build/include/config.mk. Otherwise just leave it 
alone. Non-sun people will have to modify it anyway.

make all

This builds the whole thing. With luck all the executables you
need will end up in build/bin/*.

The callbook and my system configuration files are in the file
called live/TAR. Here is how to unpack it:

cd live
tar xf TAR
rm TAR
foreach i (`cat LIST`)
echo $i
uncompress $i
end


Copy the following directories from your old bbs to your new one.
The formats will be unchanged.

  /bbs/message/Body
  /bbs/message/Forward
  /bbs/spool
  /bbs/user
  /bbs/event
  /bbs/signatures
  /bbs/vacation
  /bbs/distrib
  /bbs/filesys
  /bbs/wp

and the file

  /bbs/etc/gate.db

All of the other files in the new etc directory will have to be hand
tailored for your needs. In some of the files the structure did
change. Use my files as a guide. These are my live files, don't
pass them around. My password for your system is in them.

After you have built the bbs you need to copy all the files in 
.../build/bin to .../live/bin

Edit your sendmail.cf file and change the "gateway" to "b_gateway".

Edit your /etc/passwd file and replace "dialin/dialinBS" with 
"b_dialin/b_dialinBS".

Edit your rc.boot (or whatever you call it) to call just this:
/nbbs/bin/b_bbsd /nbbs/etc/config
of course the /nbbs may be differnent on your system. The key here
is that bbsd will spawn all the other processes. It will also
restart them if they happen to disappear.

Edit your BBS crontab entry to look like this:

0,20,40 * * * * /nbbs/bin/b_bbs -t6 -vTNC1
20 * * * * /nbbs/bin/b_bbs -t6 -vTNC0
3,13,23,33,43,53 * * * * /nbbs/bin/b_bbs -t6 -vSMTP
7,17,27,37,47,57 * * * * /nbbs/bin/b_bbs -t6 -vTCP
1,11,21,31,41,51 * * * * /nbbs/bin/b_process

Again your paths may very. The key thing here is the new command
line options for these programs. They used to be "bbsfwd". If
you want to specify a particular bbs to forward to just add the
bbs call to the end, it has no switch option.

Cross your fingers and fire it up :)

Then go on a long vacation... Trust me :)
